# Production Environment Configuration
# When running behind a reverse proxy like Traefik, use relative URLs

# Backend API URL
# For production behind reverse proxy, use relative URL:
VITE_API_URL=/api

# For development or if frontend/backend are on different domains:
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# Umami Analytics Configuration (OPTIONAL - Fallback only)
# NOTE: Primary Umami configuration should be done through Admin UI > Settings > Analytics
# These environment variables serve as fallbacks when backend settings are not available
# 
# Real-world example values:
# VITE_UMAMI_URL=https://analytics.picpeak.com
# VITE_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID=b4d3c2a1-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab
# VITE_UMAMI_SHARE_URL=https://analytics.picpeak.com/share/Ab3Cd5Fg/picpeak-gallery
